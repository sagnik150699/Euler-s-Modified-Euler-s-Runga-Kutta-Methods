# Euler's Modified Euler's Runga Kutta Methods

# Numerical Methods for ODEs in C

This repository provides implementations of popular numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The methods included are Euler's, Modified Euler's, and the Runge-Kutta method.

## Features

- **Euler's Method**: A simple and foundational method for approximating solutions to ODEs.
- **Modified Euler's Method**: An improved version of Euler's method that offers better accuracy.
- **Runge-Kutta Method**: A more advanced method that provides even greater accuracy for many problems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC Compiler

### Compilation

```bash
gcc main.c -o my_program
